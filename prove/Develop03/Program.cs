// for my creative notes for this project, I've been doing some personal projects outside of this class to learn some more about c# so that when the group project comes around I am an asset to the team, with that being said, I learned how to edit, adjust, and use the terminal in C# this week. 
// Here are some of my references that I used to learn and further develop my skills to code //
// this channel has been immensely helpful to learning and combatting the fatigue of mastering some of the basic syntax of C#: Brackeys
